# dwm

this is my old build of dwm

it still works and is very usable (check the wiki for installation), but I dont really like whats become of it right now
some time in the future i might make another dwm build that is still somewhat suckless

im not deleting this repo and making it an archive instead as i think it has quite a few [neat](https://github.com/nuxshed/dwm/wiki/Layout-Switcher) [features](https://github.com/nuxshed/dwm/wiki/Features) that others (or even me) might want to look into in the future

dwm is an extremely fast, small, and dynamic window manager for X.
